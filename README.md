### Suggested structure:

* Motivation
* Limit theorems for exceedance time and exceedance level
    - self similarity in special case (Frechet?)
* Joint distribution of exceedance time and exceedance level (at one time)
* Semi-Markov property 
    - of CTRM process
    - of scaling limit 
* Point process representation of record times and records 
    - for CTRM 
    - for CTRM limit
* Governing equations: 
    - Write Extremal process as a Markov process with generator
    - Introduce subordination
