abstract = {Continuous Time Random Maxima are a generalization of classical extreme value theory: Instead of observing random events at regular intervals in time or with exponential distributed interarrival times, the waiting times between the events are also arbitrarily random variables. In case that the waiting times between the events have infinite mean, the limit process that appears differs from the limit process that appears in the classical case. With a continuous mapping approach we derive a limit theorem for the case that the waiting times are coupled to the subsequent events and for the case that the waiting times are coupled to the preceding events (in this case we speak of an Oracle Continuous Time Random Maxima, abbr. OCTRM). We get the distribution functions of the limit processes and a formula for a Laplace transform for the CTRM and the OCTRM limit. With this formula we have another way to calculate the distribution functions of the limit processes, namely by inversion of the Laplace transform and we get governing equations, which are in our case time fractional differential equations whose solutions are the distribution functions of our limit processes. Because of the inverse relationship between the CTRM and its first hitting time we get also the Laplace transform of the distribution function of the first hitting time.},

These fractional equations are derived asymptotically from basic random walk models, and from a generalised master equation. Several physical consequences are discussed which are relevant to dynamical processes in complex systems. Methods of solution are introduced and for some special cases exact solutions are calculated. This report demonstrates that fractional equations have come of age as a complementary tool in the description of anomalous transport processes.},

In the frame of the model, we described stochastic evolution of a typical share price on a stock exchange with a moderate liquidity within a high-frequency time scale. The model was validated by satisfactory agreement of the theoretical velocity autocorrelation function with its empirical counterpart obtained for the continuous quotation. This agreement is mainly a result of a sharp backward correlation found and considered in this article. This correlation is a reminiscence of such a bid-ask bounce phenomenon where backward price jump has the same or almost the same length as preceding jump. We suggested that this correlation dominated the dynamics of the stock market with moderate liquidity. Although assumptions of the model were inspired by the market high-frequency empirical data, its potential applications extend beyond the financial market, for instance, to the field covered by the Le Chatelier-Braun principle of contrariness.},

The role of EVT is to allow the development of procedures that are scientifically and statistically rational to estimate the extreme behavior of random processes. We have performed extensive simulation experiments by taking traffic data that is greater than a given threshold value. The results of our experiments and analysis show the wireless network traffic model obtained through the EVT fits well with the empirical distribution of traffic. Meanwhile, we can obtain EVT model has the lowest "average deviation" compared with other popular distribution model such as exponential, lognormal, gamma, Weibull. Thus illustrates EVT is more suitable than other distributions to model the traffic and it has a good application foreground in the analysis of wireless network traffic.},

abstract = {This paper develops extreme value theory for random observations separated by random waiting times whose exceedence probability falls off like a power law. In the case where the waiting times between observations have an infinite mean, a limit theorem is established, where the limit is comprised of an extremal process whose time index is randomized according to the non-Markovian hitting time process for a stable subordinator. The resulting limit distributions are shown to be solutions of fractional differential equations, where the order of the fractional time derivative coincides with the power law index of the waiting time. The probability that the limit process remains below a threshold is also computed. For waiting times with finite mean but infinite variance, a two-scale argument yields a fundamentally different limit process. The resulting limit is an extremal process whose time index is randomized according to the first passage time of a positively skewed stable L??vy motion with positive drift. This two-scale limit provides a second-order correction to the usual limit behavior. ?? 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Social, technological, and economic time series are divided by events which are usually assumed to be random, albeit with some hierarchical structure. It is well known that the interevent statistics observed in these contexts differs from the Poissonian profile by being long-tailed distributed with resting and active periods interwoven. Understanding mechanisms generating consistent statistics has therefore become a central issue. The approach we present is taken from the continuous-time random-walk formalism and represents an analytical alternative to models of nontrivial priority that have been recently proposed. Our analysis also goes one step further by looking at the multifractal structure of the interevent times of human decisions. We here analyze the intertransaction time intervals of several financial markets. We observe that empirical data describe a subtle multifractal behavior. Our model explains this structure by taking the pausing-time density in the form of a superstatistics where the integral kernel quantifies the heterogeneous nature of the executed tasks. A stretched exponential kernel provides a multifractal profile valid for a certain limited range. A suggested heuristic analytical profile is capable of covering a broader region.},

abstract = {We study the statistics of return intervals between large heartbeat intervals (above a certain threshold Q) in 24 h records obtained from healthy subjects.

As a consequence, the probability W(Q)(t; Delta t) that at least one large heartbeat interval will occur within the next Delta t heartbeat intervals, with an increasing elapsed number of intervals t after the last large heartbeat interval, follows a power-law. Based on these results, we suggest a method of obtaining a priori information about the occurrence of the next large heartbeat interval, and thus to predict it. We show explicitly that the proposed method, which exploits long-term memory, is superior to the conventional precursory pattern recognition technique, which focuses solely on short-term memory. We believe that our results can be straightforwardly extended to obtain more reliable predictions in other physiological signals like blood pressure, as well as in other complex records exhibiting multifractal behaviour, e.g. turbulent flow, precipitation, river flows and network traffic.},

The behaviour of this functional depends on the relative size of ∆ and $\tau$ with respect to T and enables to give a full account of the second-order structure. As an application, we develop our results in the context of financial statistics. We introduced in [17] a micro- scopic stochastic model for the variations of a multivariate financial asset, based on Hawkes processes and that is confined to live on a tick grid. We derive and characterise the exact macroscopic diffusion limit of this model and show in particular its ability to reproduce important empirical stylised fact such as the Epps effect and the lead-lag effect.

abstract = {Despite their importance for urban planning, traffic forecasting and the spread of biological and mobile viruses, our understanding of the basic laws governing human motion remains limited owing to the lack of tools to monitor the time-resolved location of individuals. Here we study the trajectory of 100,000 anonymized mobile phone users whose position is tracked for a six-month period. We find that, in contrast with the random trajectories predicted by the prevailing L{\'{e}}vy flight and random walk models, human trajectories show a high degree of temporal and spatial regularity, each individual being characterized by a time-independent characteristic travel distance and a significant probability to return to a few highly frequented locations. After correcting for differences in travel distances and the inherent anisotropy of each trajectory, the individual travel patterns collapse into a single spatial probability distribution, indicating that, despite the diversity of their travel history, humans follow simple reproducible patterns. This inherent similarity in travel patterns could impact all phenomena driven by human mobility, from epidemic prevention to emergency response, urban planning and agent-based modelling.},

abstract = {The paper proposes a formal estimation procedure for parameters of the fractional Poisson process (fPp). Such procedures are needed to make the fPp model usable in applied situations. The basic idea of fPp, motivated by experimental data with long memory is to make the standard Poisson model more flexible by permitting non-exponential, heavy-tailed distributions of interarrival times and different scaling properties. We establish the asymptotic normality of our estimators for the two parameters appearing in our fPp model. This fact permits construction of the corresponding confidence intervals. The properties of the estimators are then tested using simulated data. ?? 2010 Elsevier B.V.},

We show that in both data sets the relevant quantities (probability density functions and the autocorrelation function of the interoccurrence times, as well as the conditional return period) are governed by power laws with exponents that depend explicitly on the considered threshold. By studying a large number of representative financial records (market indices, stock prices, exchange rates, and commodities), we show explicitly that the interoccurrence times between large daily returns follow the same behavior, in a nearly quantitative manner. We conclude that this kind of behavior is a general consequence of the nonlinear memory inherent in the multifractal data sets.},

In the case where the energy distance is computed with the semimetric of negative type, a positive definite kernel, termed distance kernel, may be defined such that the MMD corresponds exactly to the energy distance. Conversely, for any positive definite kernel, we can interpret the MMD as energy distance with respect to some negative-type semimetric. This equivalence readily extends to distance covariance using kernels on the product space. We determine the class of probability distributions for which the test statistics are consistent against all alternatives. Finally, we investigate the performance of the family of distance kernels in two-sample and independence tests: we show in particular that the energy distance most commonly employed in statistics is just one member of a parametric family of kernels, and that other choices from this family can yield more powerful tests.},

We also quantify how the conditional distribution Pq(tau/tau0) depends on the previous return interval tau0 and find that small (or large) return intervals are more likely to be followed by small (or large) return intervals.

abstract = {Network models with preferential attachment, where new nodes are injected into the network and form links with existing nodes proportional to their current connectivity, have been well studied for some time. Extensions have been introduced where nodes attach proportionally to arbitrary fitness functions. However, in these models, attaching to a node always increases the ability of that node to gain more links in the future. We study network growth where nodes attach proportionally to the clustering coefficients, or local densities of triangles, of existing nodes. Attaching to a node typically lowers its clustering coefficient, in contrast to preferential attachment or rich-get-richer models. This simple modification naturally leads to a variety of rich phenomena, including aging, non-Poissonian bursty dynamics, and community formation. This theoretical model shows that complex network structure can be generated without artificially imposing multiple dynamical mechanisms and may reveal potentially overlooked mechanisms present in complex systems.},

While current spreading models assume that users interact uniformly in time, following a Poisson process, a series of recent measurements indicates that the intercontact time distribution is heavy tailed, corresponding to a temporally inhomogeneous bursty contact process. Here we show that the non-Poisson nature of the contact dynamics results in prevalence decay times significantly larger than predicted by the standard Poisson process based models. Our predictions are in agreement with the detailed time resolved prevalence data of computer viruses, which, according to virus bulletins, show a decay time close to a year, in contrast with the 1 day decay predicted by the standard Poisson process based models.},

The arrival of claims in insurance or shocks in engineering applications is frequently modelled in this way. The distribution of the maximum of such observations until a given time is well understood in the relatively straightforward case of the renewal process with finite mean interarrival times. The limiting behaviour of the maximum in the infinite mean case is more challenging, but it was characterised under certain assumptions.   In this article, we extend the previously established results in this setting, and show how one can characterise asymptotic behaviour of all upper order statistics in the sequence of observations collected at renewal times. In contrast to the previous studies, we base our analysis in the point processes theory. We study certain well--known types of dependence between observations and interarrival times, relaxing the conditions previously seen in the literature. Finally, we show how our approach yields some new results concerning, for instance, the maximal sojourn time of a continuous time random walk.},

abstract = {The time histogram is a fundamental tool for representing the inhomogeneous density of event occurrences such as neuronal firings. The shape of a histogram critically depends on the size of the bins that partition the time axis. In most neurophysiological studies, however, researchers have arbitrarily selected the bin size when analyzing fluctuations in neuronal activity. A rigorous method for selecting the appropriate bin size was recently derived so that the mean integrated squared error between the time histogram and the unknown underlying rate is minimized (Shimazaki & Shinomoto, 2007 ). This derivation assumes that spikes are independently drawn from a given rate. However, in practice, biological neurons express non-Poissonian features in their firing patterns, such that the spike occurrence depends on the preceding spikes, which inevitably deteriorate the optimization. In this letter, we revise the method for selecting the bin size by considering the possible non-Poissonian features. Improvement in the goodness of fit of the time histogram is assessed and confirmed by numerically simulated non-Poissonian spike trains derived from the given fluctuating rate. For some experimental data, the revised algorithm transforms the shape of the time histogram from the Poissonian optimization method.},

Frequent behaviors in such complex systems have been shown to be closely related to q-statistics instead, based on the nonadditive entropy Sq (with S1=SBG), and its associated q-exponential factor which generalizes the usual BG one. In fact, a wide range of phenomena of quite different nature exist which can be described and, in the simplest cases, understood through analytic (and explicit) functions and probability distributions which exhibit some universal features. Universality classes are concomitantly observed which can be characterized through indices such as q.

@article{MacDonald2011,
abstract = {Extreme value theory is used to derive asymptotically motivated models for unusual or rare events, e.g. the upper or lower tails of a distribution. A new flexible extreme value mixture model is proposed combining a non-parametric kernel density estimator for the bulk of the distribution with an appropriate tail model. The complex uncertainties associated with threshold choice are accounted for and new insights into the impact of threshold choice on density and quantile estimates are obtained. Bayesian inference is used to account for all uncertainties and enables inclusion of expert prior information, potentially overcoming the inherent sparsity of extremal data. A simulation study and empirical application for determining normal ranges for physiological measurements for pre-term infants is used to demonstrate the performance of the proposed mixture model. The potential of the proposed model for overcoming the lack of consistency of likelihood based kernel bandwidth estimators when faced with heavy tailed distributions is also demonstrated. ?? 2011 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {The mathematical description of diffusion has a long history with many different formulations including phenomenological models based on conservation of mass and constitutive laws; probabilistic models based on random walks and central limit theorems; microscopic stochastic models based on Brownian motion and Langevin equations; and mesoscopic stochastic models based on master equations and Fokker–Planck equations. A fundamental result common to the different approaches is that the mean square displacement of a diffusing particle scales linearly with time. However there have been numerous experimental measurements in which the mean square displacement of diffusing particles scales as a fractional order power law in time. In recent years a great deal of progress has been made in extending the different models for diffusion to incorporate this fractional diffusion. The tools of fractional calculus have proven very useful in these developments, linking together fractional constitutive laws, continuous time random walks, fractional Langevin equations and fractional Brownian motions. These notes provide a tutorial style overview of standard and fractional diffusion processes.},

From a statistical perspective, the threshold is loosely defined such that the population tail can be well approximated by an extreme value model (e.g., the generalised Pareto distribution), obtaining a balance between the bias due to the asymptotic tail approximation and parameter estimation uncer-tainty due to the inherent sparsity of threshold excess data. This paper reviews recent advances and some traditional approaches, focusing on those that provide quantifica-tion of the associated uncertainty on inferences (e.g., return level estimation).},

Using several estimation methods, we find that the Hawkes kernel is power-law with a decay exponent close to -1.15 at short times, less than approximately 10^3 seconds, and crosses over to a second power-law regime with a larger decay exponent of approximately -1.45 for longer times scales in the range [10^3, 10^6] seconds. More importantly, we find that the Hawkes kernel integrates to unity independently of the analysed period, from 1998 to 2011. This suggests that markets are and have always been close to criticality, challenging a recent study which indicates that reflexivity (endogeneity) has increased in recent years as a result of increased automation of trading. However, we note that the scale over which market events are correlated has decreased steadily over time with the emergence of higher frequency trading.},

abstract = {Inhomogeneous temporal processes, like those appearing in human communications, neuron spike trains, and seismic signals, consist of high-activity bursty intervals alternating with long low-activity periods. In recent studies such bursty behavior has been characterized by a fat-tailed inter-event time distribution, while temporal correlations were measured by the autocorrelation function. However, these characteristic functions are not capable to fully characterize temporally correlated heterogenous behavior. Here we show that the distribution of the number of events in a bursty period serves as a good indicator of the dependencies, leading to the universal observation of power-law distribution for a broad class of phenomena. We find that the correlations in these quite different systems can be commonly interpreted by memory effects and described by a simple phenomenological model, which displays temporal behavior qualitatively similar to that in real systems.},

Various properties of the discrete failure distribution $P_k$ are shown to be reflected in corresponding properties of the continuous life distribution $H(t)$. As an example, if $P_k$ has discrete increasing hazard rate, then $H(t)$ has continuous increasing hazard rate. Properties of $P_k$ are obtained from various physically motivated models, including that in which damage resulting from shocks accumulates until exceedance of a threshold results in failure. We extend our results to continuous wear processes. Applications of interest in renewal theory are obtained. Total positivity theory is used in deriving many of the results.},
